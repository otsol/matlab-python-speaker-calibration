Pseudo code
Algorithm norm is
	v: Vector x in dB scale
	i: index that that is used as a reference, will be 0 (in dB scale)
	output: Vector y that is the vector x normalized to
	
	y = v - v(i)
	
	return y


algorithm equalization-inverse-frequency-response is
	input: Vector x, which is an impulse response
	input: Fs that is the sampling frequency of the impulse response
	input: norm_f that is the reference frequency used for normalization
	output: Vector y that is the inverse of x in frequency domain


	
	X=fft(x)
	X=abs(X)
	X_db=20 * log_10(X)
	i = floor(length(X)/2/((Fs/2)/f_norm));
	X_db_norm = norm(X_db, i)
	
	(Note: X_db_norm+(-X_db_norm)= [0,0,0,0,....,0,0]

	X_inverted_norm = 10^( (-X_db_norm) )
	y = ifft(X_inverted_norm)

	return y
